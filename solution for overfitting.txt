1.)Resampling of existing dataset
Check the performance
If does not improve try to get more balanced/negative,neutral articles

2.)Class Weights in Loss Function:
Assign higher weights to the negative and neutral classes during training. This will force the model to focus more on getting those predictions right.

3.)Use More Diverse Data Types:(very new kind of solution)
Expand your dataset with more examples of negative and neutral sentiment, especially those that relate to different contexts (not just market news but earnings calls, regulatory reports, etc.).

4.)Regularization & Early Stopping:(implement with every solution)
You may be seeing overfitting to the positive class due to the imbalance. Increase regularization (like dropout) and implement early stopping based on validation loss or recall for minority classes.
