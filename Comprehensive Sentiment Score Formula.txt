Comprehensive Sentiment Score Formula

    Calculate Sentiment Intensity for Each Article:
        Assign a sentiment intensity score si​ to each article ii, where si​ ranges from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive). Neutral articles might score around 0.

    Weight Articles:
        Assign a weight wiwi​ to each article based on factors like recency or source credibility. The weighted sentiment intensity for each article is si×wi.

    Apply Time Decay:
        To account for the recency of the article, apply a time decay factor. Let ti​ be the time since the article was published (in days). You can use an exponential decay function: decayi=e−λt, where λ is the decay rate. The weighted and decayed sentiment intensity for each article is si×wi×decayi

    Aggregate Scores:
        Sum up the weighted, decayed sentiment intensities for all articles: Total Sentiment=∑(si×wi×decayi)

    Normalize the Score:
        To normalize, determine the maximum and minimum possible sentiment scores (based on historical data or predefined thresholds). Normalize the aggregated score to a desired range, e.g., [-1, 1]. Let maxscoremaxscore​ and minscoreminscore​ be these thresholds. The normalized score is:
        Normalized Sentiment Score=Total Sentiment−minscoremaxscore−minscore×2−1
        Normalized Sentiment Score=maxscore​−minscore​Total Sentiment−minscore​​×2−1
        This ensures the score falls within the range [-1, 1].

Summary of Steps:

    Compute sentiment intensity si for each article.
    Apply weighting wi.
    Apply time decay decayi.
    Sum up weighted, decayed intensities: Total Sentiment
    Normalize the total score.
