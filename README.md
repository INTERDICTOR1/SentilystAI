Data Collection and Sources

SentilystAI collects and processes data from various news sources, including:

    Quantexa API
    Aylien API
    Yahoo Finance

Data is fetched in real-time, and articles are analyzed using our fine-tuned machine learning model to assess the overall sentiment.
Sentiment Analysis

We use a fine-tuned version of FinBERT, a transformer-based model trained on financial data, to predict the sentiment of news articles. The sentiment can be classified as positive, neutral, or negative, with additional intensity scores ranging from 0 to 1. The platform uses several metrics, including time decay and weighted sentiment scores, to provide actionable insights.
Sentiment Scoring Formula

Our sentiment analysis engine uses a proprietary scoring formula that includes:

    Sentiment Intensity: A measure of how strongly positive or negative an article is.
    Time Decay: Older news articles have less impact on the overall score.
    Portfolio Weighting: Articles related to stocks in a user's portfolio are weighted more heavily.
